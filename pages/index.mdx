+ Building 21

### Story

HackOS grew with the support of Building 21, and we've so far hosted 4 hackathons in a 6-month span jointly between McGill and Waterloo, and have received 120+ registrations during this timeframe to bring people together to hack together models on ML tasks. Thank you everyone for being a part and supporting us, we'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions - and look forward to welcoming you at our next event!
