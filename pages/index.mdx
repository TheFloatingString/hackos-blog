HackOS was born in <a href="https://www.building21.ca">Building 21</a> during Fall 2024. Since its inception, we've hosted 4 hackathons in a 6-month span jointly between McGill and Waterloo, and have received 120+ registrations during this timeframe to bring people together to hack together models on ML tasks. Thank you everyone for being a part and supporting us, we'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions - and look forward to welcoming you at our next event!

If you're interseted in partnering with us, please let us know - we'd love to <a href="mailto:laurence.liang@mail.mcgill.ca">get in touch</a>!
