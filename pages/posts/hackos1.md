### Benchmarking Hackathon 1

We ran our first ever benchmarking hackathon on October 25-26 simultaneously at McGill University and at the University of Waterloo. Here are some highlights!


### Tracks

We ran four diffferent tracks for this event:

1. Bicycle detection challenge based on a subset of Microsoft COCO
2. Open Chromation Region (OCR) classification as part of `Genomic Benchmarks`
3. `TinyMMLU`
4. Whatever floats your boat!

### Projects

+ Fine-tuning a vision transformer (ViT) to detect bicycles in an MS COCO validation subsample, using synthetic bicycle generation to augment the training dataset. The final validation benchmark got ~85% acc!
+ Interpretable ML models for open chromatin region (OCR) detection
+ Another open chromatin region (OCR) detection project: Artemis, which used a ConvNet approach
+ Unsupervised segmentation for self-driving cars
+ WindDM: diffusion modelling for wind maps
+ Un poco Coco: training vision transformers (ViT) on augmented data for bicycle detection on a subsample of MS COCO
+ Some more work on self-driving cars focusing on semantic scene understanding
+ And a demo for benchmarking in the healthcare space!

### Shared Takeaways

+ Vision transformers with fine-tuning downstream can yield strong model performance
+ Revisiting traditional synthetic image geneation methods can be used to increase data availability for downstream model fine tuning
+ There is still an anecdotal gap between interpretable, classical methods and high-performing, neural network methods (that tend to lack interpretability)

### Hackathon Sponsors & Partners
