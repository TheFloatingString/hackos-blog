### DeepSeek R1 for Error Log Analysis with Rootly (YC S21)

Within days of DeepSeek R1 being released, we hosted a 2-day DeepSeek hackathon (the first in the world to our knoweldge) and partnered with Rootly (YC S21) to develop a benchmark to improve error log analysis.

### Shared Takeaways

+ **Openly accessible tools to deploy models locally is important.** Ollama and smaller-sized distillied DeepSeek R1 models made it very desirable to run DeepSeek R1 models, though computational cost and power was a blocker.
+ **DeepSeek R1 is capable of error severity classification for Apache logs.**
